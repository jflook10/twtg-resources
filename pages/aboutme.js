    <p>Hi- and welcome! My name is Jillian and I am the gardener behind The Woodlands Tx Gardener.</p>
    <p>I started my instagram account in 2019 to document my Austin garden and then evolved the page to focus on information for home and urban gardeners. We moved from Austin to The Woodlands (Spring, North Houston) in 2021. For zone specific information, this area is perfect for reaching gardeners from the gulf to Central Texas. If you stick around on my page, you&apos;ll see a range of content from local events to solid gardening practices. There is a place for any grower here! </p>
    <p>While gardening is the focus of my content but I am also a wife, mom, and software engineer. Things get a little hectic around here but I am always happy to chat- so feel free to reach out on IG.</p>
  
    <p>Happy gardening, <br/>
        Jillian
